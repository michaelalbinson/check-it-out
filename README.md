Collaborating with Michael.

## Website for keeping track and searching government bills and politicians.

We scrapped websites for information about government bills and politicians and used Python and SQLite to process and store all this data into a database. 
We used Natural Language Processing algorithms to educe important keywords in each bill and created our own search algorithms. 
We are going to use news APIs to link public opinion, stakeholders, and party support for each bill. 
Website soon to follow.
